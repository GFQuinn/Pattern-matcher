Pattern Matcher is basic regular expression pattern matcher like grep

it was created by me and Vidur Ratna for an assignment for COMPX301 Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

Pattern Matcher consists of two programs REcompile.java and REsearch.java
REcompile compiles a finite state machine from a regular expression which is then output to system.out
REsearch takes a filename as an arguement and reads from system.in to read in the finite state machine.
